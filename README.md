# Rocket Web Engineering Starter Kit

# What‚Äôs the point of this kit?

Let‚Äôs start with talking about what this kit _is not_.

_This kit is not a list of rules you have to follow when working on an engineering project._

You're an adult. And we hired you to be part of Rocket because we think you're a good developer.

Also, each client and project has its own subtleties and needs. The chances of even _being able to follow one set of rules_ for any given project is pretty much zero.

So, what‚Äôs it for then?

It‚Äôs to give you a launching off point (see what we did there? üòÅ).

It‚Äôs to give you ideas of where to start.

It‚Äôs to answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do we usually do web development at Rocket?‚Äù

It's also to share with our clients and prospective hires to see how we do things here.

Finaly, it's meant to be flexible as technology changes and our practices change over time. It's a living document, meant to be contributed to by everyone at Rocket. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.MD) for details.

# Engineering Principles

For many years, new employees at Nordstrom‚Äôs department store were given a copy of the Nordstrom Employee Handbook, it was a single 5-by-8-inch gray index card that read:

`TODO` add in photo

_Use best judgment in all situations._ With all due respect to HubSpot‚Äôs culture code or Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄòFreedom & Responsibility‚Äô manifesto, it was Johan Nordstrom who invented the idea of individual responsibility back in 1887, and he was probably suffering from rickets at the time.

While it‚Äôs a stretch to say we have ‚Äúno additional rules‚Äù, we try to keep our processes as light as possible.

Here are some other rules of thumb you can follow:

- _‚ÄúSnap In‚Äù to the client"_ - If the client is already using a tool or using a process, always go with what they already have/use, unless they‚Äôre explicitly asking for something different
- _‚ÄúStrong opinions, loosely held‚Äù_ - Never be afraid to present a case for doing something the way you think is right, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs the client‚Äôs call and you need to be flexible.
- _If in doubt, ask the exec sponsor_ - We trust your judgement, but we also trust that when you hit a situation that might ruffle feathers at a client, that you‚Äôll reach out to the right people for input, including the executive sponsor of the project.

# Before The Project

What to make sure you know about the project or company before the project starts. Try to find this out from the client or the exec sponsor:

- [ ] Are we signing up for an ID with their organization for email/calendar/other access, or using our own ID's?
- [ ] Do they have a QA Department or people available to test the product?
- [ ] Does they have their own DevOps/Sys Admin organization?
- [ ] Do they have a process for on-boarding new engineers that we can adhere to?
- [ ] Are there any tools we can install upfront to cut down ramp-up time?
- [ ] How do they prefer we communicate? For example, Slack, email...
- [ ] If we need to request access to various systems, who should we speak with? Or, what is the process they have in place, if any? If possible get this access _before_ the project starts!
- [ ] Are they doing Agile or other similar process that we need to be aware of and involved in?
- [ ] What is the release process? How often do they deploy to production and how is that pipeline setup?
- [ ] How do they manage secrets and other credentials?
- [ ] What parts of the tech stack are non-negotiable and what parts are up for changing? Is there anything in the stack today they want us to avoid?
- [ ] Are we joining an existing team or forming our own team?
- [ ] How should we let them know about time off or Rocket Holidays? Do they have a calendar they want us to use?

# Client Communication

You're an adult and we trust you can communicate with other human beings in a kind and respectful way. We like to have fun and be funny. We want to have the kind of energy which makes other engineers work with us and enjoy it.

Oh, and don't say the "F" word unless the client does first.

But, if you need help, you can see our [Client Facing Words and Tone](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11JaWCG_S4YBrCp-8aV2_Zpoz5pD4Hjkj/view?usp=sharing) document.

# Where to start with project process

Our philosophy is ‚Äúless is more.‚Äù But you do need some process. At a minimum you should have:

- A daily standup. Slack or asynchronous is fine.
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What are you doing today?
  - Any blockers?

Sometimes, during the contract process, we talk with the client indications of what process they prefer to use. Check with the exec sponsor and see if that has been done or if we have some more freedom. In those cases, we don‚Äôt prescribe whether the team should use Scrum or Kanban, but pick one, and follow it‚Äôs core principles to run the project.

Pick a senior member of the team to be responsible for running the ceremonies. Consider making it a shared responsiblity.

# Where to start with a technical design or architecture

The answer of where to start with a design for your project will likely come as part of a Statement of Work (SOW) or contract from the client. It will generally indicate that we‚Äôre going to implement a project in node/react/java/whatever. We should use that as a basis.

If you we a completely greenfield web project with all choices given to us to make, our standard setup would be:

- React web frontend
- Node.js REST API
- PostGres database

Not every project is going to fit that mold, though. But for many simpler projects, it will.

Another major choice to make is where the application will be deployed. For a smaller client with no plans to hire DevOps support, we recommend deploying to Heroku. For clients who have, plan to have, a DevOps team, we recommend deploying to AWS. If the choice is there, we recommend using Elastic Container Service.

- Is there a lot of content frequently edited? Consider a headless CMS. See [Evaluating your tech stack - Content Management Systemse](https://blog.rocketinsights.com/evaluating-your-tech-stack-content-management-systems/)
- Our standard setup is node.js with a react frontend and a postgres database. But there are plenty of reasons to break from this, even on a greenfield project.

## Preferred setup - Node.js flavor

- React frontend
  - See [React preferred practices](/preferred-practices/react.js)
- Node.js REST API
  - See [Node.js preferred practices](/preferred-practices/node.js)
- PostGres Database
- AWS Based Deployment Infrastructure
  - S3 based deployment of React App
  - Docker based Deployment of Node API in Elastic Container Service
  - Aurora PostGres compatible database

## Preferred setup - ‚òï Java flavor

- React frontend
  - See [React preferred practices](/preferred-practices/react.js)
- Spring Boot based API
  - API created using https://start.spring.io/
- PostGres Database
- AWS Based Deployment Infrastructure
  - S3 based deployment of React App
  - Docker based Deployment of API in Elastic Container Service
  - Aurora PostGres compatible database

# Suggested Tools

You're an adult (noticing a theme yet?), use what tools you think are effective and that you prefer. But if you're looking for ideas, many Rocket web developers use the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - For editing
- [TablePlus](https://www.tableplus.io/download) - For database stuff
- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) - ...Maybe we shouldn't even put it here but they're just so good!
- `TODO` what else?

# Language/Framework Preferred Practices

These are not meant to be comprehensive _by any means_. You may even find conflicting ideas in these documents. The idea is to give you a list of things our experienced engineers have found to _consider_ for your project. The use of the word _preferred_ is very intentional.

- [General Preferred Practices](/preferred-practices/general.md)
- [Javascript Preferred Practices](/preferred-practices/javascript.md)
- [React Preferred Practices](/preferred-practices/react.md) (in `TODO` status)
- [Node.js Preferred Practices](/preferred-practices/nodejs.md)
