This kit is meant to be a living document that we at Rocket collaborate on.

If you're a client, and want to see something in here, please submit an issue and we'll address it!

If you're a Rocket developer and if you think something should be changed in here, submit an issue or submit a pull request.

Rules of engagement:

- Be respectful and open minded when submitting issues, providing feedback or providing contributions.
- Strong opinions, loosely held. This is a gathering of our recommendations and preferences, but if something is hotly contested _we should acknowledge it_ and consider just saying "We haven't come to a conclusion on which is better" and provide both sides of the argument.
