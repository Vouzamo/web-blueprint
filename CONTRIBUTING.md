This is meant to be a set of living documents that we at Rocket collaborate on.

If you're a client, and want to see something in here, please submit an issue and we'll address it!

If you're a Rocket developer and if you think something should be changed in here, submit an issue or submit a pull request.

Rules of engagement:

1. The main README.md file should be Rocket wide recommendations and avoid specific technology recommendations.
1. Anyone at Rocket can submit a Soapbox for a particular topic. Be sure to:
   1. Add a link to the appropriate category (or add a new one if necessary)
   1. Credit yourself along with your github handle
1. Be respectful and open minded when submitting issues, providing feedback or providing contributions.
1. Remeber, this is _public content_ that will reflect on Rocket. We want it to be polished, thoughtful
   and respectful.
1. Strong opinions, loosely held. This is a gathering of our collective recommendations, but if something is hotly contested _we should acknowledge it_ and consider just saying "We haven't come to a conclusion on which is better" and provide both sides of the argument.
1. Be cautious about recommending specific _tools_ and try to recommend preferred _practices_. You can provide a suggestion for a tool, but the real preferred practice is probably "higher up." For instance, you think that Jest is the best testing framework. That's an opinion that someone is going to have good reasons to disagree with (let's face it many people might). Also, that will likely change over time. The preferred practice we want documented here is "Write automated tests using a well supported framework. For example, Jest." If literally everyone has the same opinion that a tool should be used, we can document it as a preferred practice.
1. Don't contribute for _completeness sake_. This project will never be complete. Contribute things that instead original and helpful.
